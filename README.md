# i dunno why i made this - vinay first commit

make sure u got npm
remember to "cd combatwombatsftc" before running the program
then run "npm i" to install packages and whatnot
"npm run dev" to start the server
then open localhost:3000

ignore boilerplate and all code is in src/app and images and videos into the public folder and access them via next/nameoffile

i installed tailwind (like another type of css thing) by default, cos its inbuilt and i like it but feel free to run "npm i bootstrap@5.3.3"
