# i dunno why i made this - vinay first commit

make sure u got npm
remember to "cd combatwombatsftc" before running the program
then run "npm i" to install packages and whatnot
"npm run dev" to start the server
then open localhost:3000

ignore boilerplate and all code is in src/app and images and videos into the public folder and access them via next/nameoffile

i installed tailwind (like another type of css thing) by default, cos its inbuilt and i like it but feel free to run "npm i bootstrap@5.3.3"

# from: discord

all u gotta do is use a website like this ![https://dillinger.io/] and create the docs u want in markdown
i made it parse most of the md styles but if u want more i can make it (eg. i didnt make it parse tables)
then u gotta put the .md files u want in the contrans (content transfer) folder in the root of the combatwombatsftc
then u gotta be cd'd into the root folder (not the nextjs subfolder) and run node index.ts
thatll set up the docs page
